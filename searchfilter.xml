The searchfilter.xml works in tandem with the user specific search filitering (see the MP_SEARCH_FILTER_HEADER,
MP_SEARCH_FILTER_PARAM_REF and MP_SEARCH_FILTER_DETAIL tables). The search filter tables are important 
in getting search filtering to work. The MP_SEARCH_FILTER_HEADER table has columns for multiple 
database column names and database values. Sometimes these database values will want to be a concatenation
or various items in the MP_SEARCH_FILTER_PARAM_REF table. The primary keys of those two tables is what is 
used in this xml. 

In the dbColumn tag, you are linking the SFH_DBCOLUMN[1-5] to a entry in the MP_SEARCH_FILTER_PARAM_REF
table. The column value in the dbColumn tag contains the [1-5] of the SFH-DBCOLUMN[1-5]. The param value is
the primary key of the param ref whose db column will populate this column. If you have an entry in the
search filter header that will be made up of multiple items, it only needs one entry in the dbColumns tag.

The trickier bit is the dbValues. Say you have a GL Code that is made up of three parts 123-456-789.
You want to have different limitations on each part. In that case each section, section1, section2, 
and section3 are entries in the MP_SEARCH_FILTER_PARAM_REF tables. What you will do is build an entry
in the header table by having in order of appearance, each part of the gl code in the dbValues table. If you want
have a permanent item in you header, you can use a param value of "0". For example the entry

<dbValue column="1"  param="1" entry =""/>
<dbValue column="1"  param="0" entry ="-"/>
<dbValue column="1"  param="2" entry =""/>

Will create a string like param1+"-"+param2 in your header table.
