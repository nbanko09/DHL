<!--
The file names listed in here will be search *in order* for a label.  The first file
in this list must also define the default locale.  Subsequent attempts to redefine the
default locale will be ignored.

Default file list are all located in the common root folder:
	<file name="labels.xml" /> 		
	<file name="Pay\labels.xml" />  This will insure that Active Search always uses any overrides from Active Pay
	<file name="labels-over-ride.xml" />
	<file name="leftNavigationLabels.xml" />
    <file name="adminlabels.xml" />
    <file name="workflowMessages.xml" />
    <file name="adminMessages.xml"/>
    <file name="reportinglabels.xml"/>
	<file name="leftNavLabels-default.xml" />
	<file name="labels-default.xml"/>
	
	
1. The common\labels.xml file should not contain any label definitions.  It must exist, but it is no longer used.
2. Common label changes may be made in the labels-over-ride.xml.  Never edit the common-default.xml or the leftNavLabels-default.xml files.
3. Application label overrides should be defined in the specific applicaton folder labels.xml.  (ex: Pay\labels.xml)
3. The [App Name]\labels.xml (ex: Expense\labels.xml), should only be present when label overrides are required for that specific application. 
4. Expense\labels.xml is always required to update Expense labels and will include the default Expense label overrides.  Leave the default section in place, but add the new over rids
5. The common\labels-default.xml file typically contains the default labels for Active Pay and Active Expense and the use of Pay\labels.xml is only required for customer specfic label overrides.
6. The search\labels.xml should be deleted.  In that way, the application will select the Pay\labels.xml by default.
7. The labelSearchOrder.xml, should only be present in the common\ folder path.  It would be ignored in the application paths.
8. The same rules are true of leftNavigationLabels.xml and lefNavLabels-default.xml.   The file is only required in the override path when label changes are required.



By default the folder root application paths will containg ONLY the following files  during the baseline deployment:
Pay\leftNavigationLabels.xml
Expense\leftNavigationLabels.xml and labels.xml
Search\leftNavigationLabels.xml

To overright application levellabels, add the labels.xml to the path, but only add labels that will be over written of the default files.
